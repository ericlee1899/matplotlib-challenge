# Matplotlib Homework - The Power of Plots  
Analysis:  
The initial total mouse count is 1893 but once we filter it to remove duplicate, its count goes down to 249 unique mice.  
When we take a look at the interquartile ranges, it appears that Capomulin and Ramicane are similar while Infubinol and Ceftamin are also similar. After taking a closer look, Capomulin has a higher max and median than Ramicane which means that the overall range is larger. Ceftamin has a much larger boxplot than Infubinol as Infubinol's boxplot is also closer to the min which indicates most of its value are closer to the min.  
Their appears to be a strong positive correlation between average tumour volume and mouse weight. The r value calculated was 0.84 which indicates a strong correlation while the linear model was y=0.95x+21.55. Since the linear model was almost a perfect unity slope of 1, it shows that the model is a strong indicator of the correlation. We cannot confirmed that there is a correlation between these two variables without further research but it appears that these two variables may be dependent of one another.
